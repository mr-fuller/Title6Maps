# Title6Maps
Get ACS data from the appropriate API and join them to Census Tract and Block Group feature classes used for Title 6 and Environmental Justice analyses.

# How to use
Run 'main.py' with all the other python files in the same directory. And I suppose you need ArcMap for joining the data to the geographies part. You can use QGIS and get spatial files from the Census Website or API. I will work to perform spatial operations with gdal bindings or geopandas so that the script can be run without ArcMap from soup to nuts.
